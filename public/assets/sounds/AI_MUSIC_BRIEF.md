## Sound Design Requirements

### Musical Style & Genre
**Primary Genre:** Ambient Electronic / Corporate Futurism
**Sub-genres to blend:**
- Minimal Tech House (subtle rhythm, not overwhelming)
- Atmospheric Synth-wave (technology feel)
- Corporate Ambient (professional backdrop)
- Subtle World Music elements (reflecting global reach, especially African and Indian influences)

### Sonic Characteristics

#### Tempo & Rhythm
- **BPM:** 72-80 BPM (relaxed, confident pace)
- **Time Signature:** 4/4 for stability
- **Rhythm:** Subtle pulse, not driving - think "data flowing" rather than "dancing"

#### Instrumentation & Textures
**Primary Elements:**
- Warm synthetic pads (representing cloud/connectivity)
- Subtle electric piano or marimba (human touch, approachability)
- Deep, round sub-bass (foundation, reliability)
- Crystalline bell tones or chimes (clarity, precision)
- Soft white noise sweeps (data transmission feel)

**Secondary Elements:**
- Subtle tabla or African percussion (global presence) - very soft, almost subliminal
- Processed vocal textures (human connection) - no lyrics, just "oohs" or "aahs"
- Digital glitch effects (innovation) - used sparingly
- Reverse reverbs (forward-thinking)

#### Harmonic Structure
- **Key:** C Major or A Minor (universal, accessible)
- **Chord Progression:** Simple, confident - suggest: C - Am - F - G or variations
- **Use suspended chords** (Csus2, Gsus4) for openness
- **Occasional maj7 chords** for sophistication

### Emotional Journey & Arc

#### 0-5 seconds: Opening
- Fade in with atmospheric pad
- Single bell tone or chime (brand recognition)
- Establish the "space" - should feel like entering a modern, high-tech lobby

#### 5-15 seconds: Building Connection
- Introduce subtle rhythm (soft kick drum, hi-hat whispers)
- Layer in melodic element (electric piano or soft synth lead)
- Add warmth - this is where the "human" element appears

#### 15-25 seconds: Full Expression
- All elements present but balanced
- Should feel like systems working in harmony
- Convey reliability and flow
- Subtle dynamic movement (gentle filter sweeps)

#### 25-30 seconds: Loop Point
- Seamless loop back to 5-second mark
- No obvious ending - continuous flow
- Maintains energy without building further

### Mood & Feeling Targets

**Primary Emotions to Evoke:**
1. **Trust** - Stable harmonic foundation
2. **Innovation** - Modern synthesis and processing
3. **Connection** - Warm, inviting tones
4. **Professionalism** - Clean production, no harsh frequencies
5. **Global Reach** - Subtle world music influences

**What It Should Feel Like:**
- Walking into a state-of-the-art data center that's surprisingly welcoming
- Watching data flow through fiber optic cables
- A successful business handshake in a modern office
- The moment when complex systems sync perfectly
- Dawn breaking over a connected city

### Technical Specifications

#### Audio Format Requirements
- **Duration:** 30 seconds (with seamless loop point at 25 seconds)
- **Sample Rate:** 48kHz
- **Bit Depth:** 24-bit
- **Format:** WAV and MP3 (320kbps)
- **Loudness:** -14 LUFS (streaming optimized)
- **True Peak:** -1dBFS maximum

#### Mixing Guidelines
- **Frequency Balance:**
  - Sub-bass (20-60Hz): Present but not overwhelming
  - Low-mids (200-500Hz): Warm but not muddy
  - Mids (1-3kHz): Clear but not harsh
  - Highs (8kHz+): Crisp but not sibilant

- **Spatial Design:**

  - Use reverb to create depth, not distance

### Cultural Sensitivity Notes
- Avoid religious or culturally specific musical phrases
- Keep world music elements subtle and respectful

### Reference Tracks (Style Guide)
Consider these as inspiration points:
1. **Brian Eno** - "An Ending (Ascent)" - for atmospheric quality
2. **Ólafur Arnalds** - "Near Light" - for emotional warmth
3. **Jon Hopkins** - "Immunity" (intro only) - for subtle tech elements
4. **Bonobo** - "Kiara" - for organic/electronic blend
5. **Tycho** - "A Walk" - for optimistic technology feel
6. **RJD2** - "Ghostwriter" (instrumental) - for confident progression

### Use Cases & Implementation

**Where This Sound Will Play:**
1. **Landing Page** - Full 30-second loop with fade-in
2. **Throughout Website** - Continues at 20% volume as ambient
3. **Product Demos** - Can increase volume during key moments
4. **Video Content** - As background for company videos
5. **Trade Shows** - Ambient playback at company booth

### Success Criteria
The final track should:
- ✓ Feel premium but not pretentious
- ✓ Work at both low and medium volumes
- ✓ Not distract from content consumption
- ✓ Enhance brand perception of reliability and innovation

# About NU GUI

NU GUI helps carriers, resellers, and enterprises deliver **reliable communications and data‑driven marketing at scale**.  
We focus on practical outcomes: **better connectivity, lower cost per minute, stronger customer engagement, and clear reporting**.

---

## Our Origin Story

NU GUI was established in **2018** through the **merger and rebrand of We Sell Solutions (WSS)**. WSS had been providing holistic telecom and direct marketing services—**VoIP, bulk SMS, cloud PBX, campaign automation, and data management**—with a hands‑on, results‑first approach.  
The rebrand consolidated those strengths into a single, focused company built for modern telecom needs.

**Leadership:** NU GUI is led by **CEO Wesley Burgess**, whose background spans telecommunications, contact‑centre optimisation, and business intelligence. Prior to NU GUI, Wesley held leadership roles at **Teleforge** and **Proforge**, and served as Managing Director of **We Sell Solutions**. His north star has stayed the same: **help businesses connect better, sell smarter, and operate more efficiently**.

## Still Need to Update

### 1. Support Form (/support)
Similar updates needed:

```

### 2. Partner Program Form
Already has business fields but needs:
```php
// Enhance existing validation
- Use new BusinessEmailValidator
- Add challenge questions
- Enhanced security tracking
```

### 3. API Routes
Create routes for AJAX validation:
```php
// app/Config/Routes.php
$routes->post('/api/check-email-domain', 'Api::checkEmailDomain');
$routes->post('/api/track-interaction', 'Api::trackInteraction');
$routes->post('/api/track-email-validation', 'Api::trackEmailValidation');
```

### 4. API Controller
```php
// app/Controllers/Api.php
class Api extends BaseController {
    public function checkEmailDomain() {
        // Check domain against rules
    }
    
    public function trackInteraction() {
        // Track form interactions
    }
    
    public function trackEmailValidation() {
        // Track email validation attempts
    }
}
```

## Security Features Implemented

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Business Email Requirement**: Only accepts business emails or personal with website verification
2. **Honeypot Fields**: Hidden fields to catch bots
3. **Time-Based Validation**: Minimum 5 seconds to fill form
4. **Interaction Tracking**: Tracks mouse movements, keystrokes, field focuses
5. **Challenge Questions**: Simple math/knowledge questions
6. **Domain Verification**: DNS and HTTP checks for company websites
7. **Rate Limiting**: Built into form security
8. **Pattern Detection**: Checks for spam keywords, excessive URLs, script injections

### Database Tracking
- All submissions logged with security metrics
- IP tracking and user agent logging
- Suspicious activity logging
- Email domain rule management

## Deployment Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**:
```bash
mysql -u root -p nugui_website < database/add_business_fields.sql
```

2. **Copy New Files**:
- app/Libraries/BusinessEmailValidator.php
- app/Libraries/EnhancedFormSecurity.php
- public/assets/js/business-validation.js

3. **Update Views**:
- Include business-validation.js in layout
```html
<script src="<?= base_url('assets/js/business-validation.js') ?>"></script>
```

4. **Test Forms**:
- Test with personal emails (should require website)
- Test with business emails (should pass)
- Test honeypot fields (should block)
- Test quick submission (should block)

## Configuration Options

### Email Domain Rules
Manage in database table `email_domain_rules`:
- **whitelist**: Always accepted domains
- **blacklist**: Blocked domains (require website)
- **requires_verification**: Need additional checks

### Security Thresholds
In EnhancedFormSecurity.php:
- Minimum form time: 5 seconds
- Maximum form time: 30 minutes
- Minimum interactions: 3
- Rate limit: Configurable per IP

## Benefits

1. **Reduces Spam**: Multi-layer protection against bots
2. **B2B Focus**: Enforces business email usage
3. **Flexibility**: Allows personal emails with verification
4. **Tracking**: Complete audit trail of submissions
5. **Non-Intrusive**: Works transparently for legitimate users
6. **Scalable**: Easy to add new rules and domains

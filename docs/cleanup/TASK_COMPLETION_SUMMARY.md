# NU GUI Website Task Completion Summary

## Task Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Branch:** devin/1754549145-clean-working-branch  
**Website Status:** ✅ ONLINE at https://www.nugui.co.za  

## Phase 1: Website Routing Fix ✅ COMPLETED

### Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: Website showing 404 errors and redirecting to "/public/" instead of loading homepage
- **Root Cause**: Missing/incorrect index.php and .htaccess configuration in public_html
- **Solution**: Uploaded corrected files via FTP to restore CodeIgniter routing

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Uploaded corrected `index.php` to `/home/nuguiyhv/public_html/`
2. ✅ Uploaded minimal `.htaccess` configuration to resolve redirect loops
3. ✅ Updated `.env` file to set `CI_ENVIRONMENT = production` (removes debug toolbar)
4. ✅ Confirmed HTTP/2 200 OK response with actual website content loading

### Verification Results
```bash
curl -I https://www.nugui.co.za
# HTTP/2 200 OK ✅
# Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 ✅
# Website title: "NU GUI - Welcome" ✅
```

## Phase 2: Image Reference Updates ✅ COMPLETED

### New Naming Convention Implemented
- **Light Theme**: Images with "1" suffix (e.g., `NUGUI-icon-1.png`)
- **Dark Theme**: Images with "2" suffix (e.g., `NUGUI-icon-2.png`)
- **Products Covered**: NU-CCS, NU-CRON, NU-DATA, NUGUI, NUSIP, NU-SMS
- **Variants**: 3 per product (logo, icon, product image) = 36 total images

### Theme Switching Implementation
```css
.product-icon-light { display: inline-block; }
.product-icon-dark { display: none; }
[data-theme="dark"] .product-icon-light { display: none; }
[data-theme="dark"] .product-icon-dark { display: inline-block; }
```

### Files Updated
- ✅ `app/Views/landing.php` - Landing page logos and favicons

- ✅ `app/Views/templates/footer-apple.php` - Footer logo switching
- ✅ `public/assets/css/styles.css` - Theme switching CSS classes
- ✅ All 36 new images properly referenced with theme-aware classes

## Phase 3: Repository Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

### Archive Structure Created
```
archived/
├── binaries/          # Development binaries (Composer-Setup.exe, etc.)
├── test_files/        # PHP diagnostic files
└── temp_ci4/         # Entire CodeIgniter4-develop directory (1000+ files)

scripts/
├── deployment/       # Active deployment scripts (quick_setup.ps1, setup_environment.ps1)
└── archived/         # Development-only scripts (6 PowerShell files)
```

### Files Moved to Archives
- ✅ **1000+ files**: Entire `temp_ci4/CodeIgniter4-develop/` → `archived/temp_ci4/`
- ✅ **Development binaries**: `Composer-Setup.exe`, `codeigniter4.zip` → `archived/binaries/`
- ✅ **Test files**: `debug_check.php`, `test_fixes.php`, `project_diagnostic.php` → `archived/test_files/`
- ✅ **PowerShell scripts**: Organized into `scripts/deployment/` (active) vs `scripts/archived/` (development-only)

### Safety Measures
- ✅ All moves documented with exact original locations
- ✅ Files moved to archives, never deleted

- ✅ Git deployment mechanism preserved and verified

## Phase 4: Server Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

### Server Directory Analysis

- ✅ Identified framework directories: `app/`, `system/`, `writable/`, `vendor/` (all restored)
- ✅ Documented protected vs cleanup candidate directories
- ✅ Created comprehensive server cleanup plan with rollback strategy

### Framework Status
